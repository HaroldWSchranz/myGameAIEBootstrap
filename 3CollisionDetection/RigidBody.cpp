// Start by implementing the constructors, which should initialize the member variables.
// The applyForce() function is where we apply Newton’s second law. 
// This function will modify the velocity of the object according to the object’s mass and how much force has been applied.
//
// Applying a force to an object will either speed it up or slow it down.That is to say, applying a force will change
// the acceleration of an object.By adding the acceleration to the current velocity, we find the object’s new velocity.
//
// As you would recall from the lecture, according to Newton’s Second Law acceleration is calculated by dividing force
// by mass(a = F / m).So, in the applyForce() function you will need to calculate accelerationand add it to the m_velocity
// member variable.You should be able to write this as one line of code.
//
// The applyForceToActor() function prototype is a variation of the applyForce() function.It allows us to simulate one
// actor “pushing” another.
// 
// You may recall Newton’s third law, which states “for every action, there is an equaland opposite reaction”.
// In the applyForceToActor() function you must first apply the input force to the input actor(by calling the applyForce()
// function of that actor), and then apply the opposite force to the current actor(by calling applyForce() on this using
// the negative force).
//
// Finally, the fixedUpdate() function will apply any forces to the actor(i.e., gravity) before calculating the final
// position.

// After applying gravity as a force, we add the updated vector to the actor’s position to get the new position of the actor.
// Why does it update position, then apply force (Integrator method?)
// Whether we apply the force of gravity before or after updating the position, we introduce a systematic error into our physics simulation. 
// For now its preferable to apply gravity afterwards.
